              1. Terms of AQQIRE Privacy Statement
              <br >
              <br >
              AQQIRE (“AQQIRE”), its affiliates, partners, subsidiaries and
              related websites and entities (collectively, "AQQIRE", "we," our,
              "us" or the "Company") all greatly value your privacy and want to
              ensure that you fully understand how AQQIRE uses and compiles your
              information. In this Privacy Statement, we will describe how
              AQQIRE handles your personal information when you use the
              Company's websites (including www.AQQIRE.com or any other website
              where this Privacy Statement is posted), programs, mobile apps,
              and all other related services (collectively, "Applications"). By
              using the Applications, you expressly consent to our collection,
              storage, management, treatment, use and disclosure of your
              personal information as described in this Statement.  
              <br >
              <br >
              2. AQQIRE's Dedication to Maintaining Your Privacy  
              <br >
              <br >
              AQQIRE takes your concerns about privacy very seriously, and is
              committed to ensuring that all your individual and corporate
              privacy needs are met. At AQQIRE, we endeavor to provide the very
              best commercial real estate services available today, and in doing
              so, we ensure that all of our sellers, buyers, real estate brokers
              and other Applications visitors or users feel confident that all
              of their information, including all of their company's
              information, is at all times very well managed and protected.
              Accordingly, all AQQIRE Applications are compliant with the Online
              Privacy Alliance Privacy Policy guidelines as they existed on the
              updated date of this Statement shown below. We understand that you
              may have questions about what we do with the information we
              collect, how we collect your information, and what specifically we
              need from each user to create a member profile and how we collect
              and use information. This Privacy Statement will provide clear and
              concise answers to all of your questions, while also detailing
              each step we take to maintain the confidentiality of your
              information. If, after reviewing this Statement, you have any
              further questions or concerns regarding your privacy, please feel
              free to email us at privacy@AQQIRE.com
              <br >
               
              <br >
              3. How AQQIRE Collects Your Information  
              <br >
              <br >
              Personal Information. While AQQIRE does need detailed information
              from its Brokers, Buyers and Sellers, we do not collect such
              personal information (including: names, addresses, telephone
              numbers, email addresses, or financial account information) from
              you when you are simply browsing our Applications or related
              features, unless you have specifically and knowingly provided us
              with personal information, (i.e., sending AQQIRE an e-mail or
              message via the AQQIRE.com message feature, by registering your
              information to receive e-mail updates or submitting information to
              create an account and become a member, submitting an offer for a
              specific property, submitting an employment application,
              completing online forms, executing a non-disclosure and/or
              confidentiality agreement, or in any other way creating a
              contractual agreement with us).   
              <br >
              <br >
              AQQIRE automatically analyzes and stores all communications
              content sent or received via the AQQIRE.com message feature,
              including email content from incoming and outgoing email.   This
              analysis occurs as it is sent, received, and when it is
              stored.  In certain use cases, AQQIRE runs automated algorithms on
              such communications to create generic templates (e.g., using
              common terms to identify the elements of a request for information
              about a Property).  These templates do not include the recipient’s
              personal data.  AQQIRE may review the templates to improve our
              Applications and personalization of your experience.  Unless
              expressly stated otherwise, you may not opt out of these
              features.    
              <br >
              <br >
              AQQIRE uses information, without limitation: to conduct research
              and development for the improvement of our Applications and
              related features in order to provide a better, more intuitive
              experience, drive engagement on our Applications and help connect
              Brokers, Buyers, Sellers and other visitors; to follow up on
              properties or services that we provide to you and to match and
              serve targeted advertising and promotions; to detect spam, malware
              and other malicious links or content; and for abuse protection –
              all as further discussed in this Privacy Statement.    
              <br >
              <br >
              Automatic Data Collection. AQQIRE will automatically collect
              information about the computers, tablets, smartphones or other
              current or future mobile or stationary devices that you use to
              login to your account, access the AQQIRE Applications, or
              otherwise review and analyze the features and information provided
              on the Applications. For example, we may collect and store
              information such as your browser type, IP address, language,
              operating system, location of your wireless device (e.g., latitude
              and longitude), the state or country from which you accessed the
              Applications, unique device identifier (e.g., a UDID or IDFA on
              Apple devices like the iPhone, iPad and MacBook), the pages you
              view, the Applications you use, the date and time of your visit,
              the websites you visited immediately before and after visiting our
              websites, error logs, and other information and data that would
              help us create better versions of our current Applications, which
              will inevitably help you do more with AQQIRE. In gathering or
              reviewing the information you give to us, we may decide to use
              third party analytics providers, software or other related
              technologies, including cookies and similar web-based tools, to
              assist in collecting this information. Once we are able to acquire
              and analyze the information that we receive from all of our users,
              we may subsequently decide to formulate various statistical models
              about how you use the AQQIRE Applications and features, which will
              help us enhance the next version of our various Applications, and
              help us provide you with tailored content and advertising that you
              want to see, while filtering out anything that you may not be
              interested in. In sum, the information AQQIRE collects
              automatically helps us know you better, which allows us to provide
              a user experience that continues to improve on multiple levels.  
              <br >
              <br >
              Disabling Location Information Tracker. If you are uncomfortable
              providing us your location statistics, you can disable our ability
              to track that information by following these instructions. If you
              are using an Apple device, click on "General," then "Reset," then
              "Reset Location and Privacy." This will turn off location
              functionality for all of your service programs, so that the next
              time you download or use an "app," you will be asked again to
              provide your consent for us and others to access your location
              information.  
              <br >
              <br >
              If you are using an Android device, visit the device settings,
              click "Location," and then click the boxes for the particular
              applications for which you would like to disable location
              Applications.  
              <br >
              <br >
              Please note that the instructions provided above may be inaccurate
              should Apple or Android service providers revise or change the
              manner in which a user's location and related information can be
              tracked after the publication of this Privacy Statement.
              Therefore, should the above directions prove ineffective, please
              consult your device's user manual, or contact your service
              provider or device's manufacturer.  
              <br >
              <br >
              Cookies. The Applications often uses the latest cookie technology,
              in addition to other related online tools, such as web beacons and
              web pixels, to generate the information necessary to best serve
              our clients. "Cookies" are small files that a website stores on a
              user's computer or device. The Applications use cookies to keep
              together the information you enter on multiple pages. The vast
              majority of the cookies AQQIRE uses are defined as "session"
              cookies, which means that they are automatically deleted from your
              hard drive after you close your browser at the end of your online
              session. These session cookies are used to optimize performance of
              the Applications and to limit the amount of redundant data that is
              downloaded during a single session, which helps us understand your
              relative interest in the variety of content AQQIRE provides. We
              also use "persistent" cookies, which remain on your computer or
              device unless deleted by you (or by your browser settings). We use
              persistent cookies for statistical analysis of performance to
              ensure the ongoing quality of our Applications. In either case, we
              do not use these cookies, or any other type for that matter, to
              obtain or keep any personal or inherently private information
              about you or your corporate entity apart from what you have
              already voluntarily provided us. Additionally, most current web
              browsers automatically accept cookies, but you may set your
              browser to block cookies if you would prefer to not provide the
              information noted above (see the "internet options" or related
              links in your specific web-browser to disable). However, if you
              decide to block cookies, this may interfere with your ability to
              perform certain actions on the Applications, use certain features
              available thereon, or access content and information that would
              otherwise be fully available to you.  
              <br >
              <br >
              Communications with You. We may use the contact information we
              collect from you during registration, as well as the information
              in the AQQIRE database (including your first and last name,
              company name, telephone number, postal address, email address and
              investment preferences) to sort and direct commercial real estate
              inquiries and related research to you. For example, we may use
              this information to follow-up on properties or services that we
              provide to you and to inform you of other opportunities, products
              and services that we think will be of interest to you.  
              <br >
              <br >
              4. Use of Your Information  
              <br >
              <br >
              We will use your information in a way that is consistent with your
              defined interests, and for purposes that enhance your user
              experience at AQQIRE, including, but not limited to, the below
              examples:  
              <br >
              <br >
              (a) Build and maintain a membership profile for your account;
              <br >
              (b) Enhance the user experience;
              <br >
              (c) Perform research and analytics;

              (d) Customize and personalize the content and advertising that you
              see on the Applications;
              <br >
              (e) Respond to and fulfill your requests for Applications;
              <br >
              (f) Determine your eligibility and profile for certain Real
              Properties available for Purchase, or for determining the best
              Application for your current needs;
              <br >
              (g) Send you information about topics or commercial properties
              that may be of interest to you, based on your previous searches,
              submitted offers, purchases and other indicators; and
              <br >
              (h) Send you a variety of communications and information related
              to your membership account, and alert you to the latest
              developments and features of the Applications currently offered at
              AQQIRE that may assist in your use of the AQQIRE platform.
              <br >
               
              <br >
              5. Advertising Analytics  
              <br >
              <br >
              The Applications that AQQIRE offers its users may include third
              party ad analytics technology, which enables customized ads to be
              displayed to you through the Applications that you consistently
              use. Please keep in mind that we do not share or sell your
              personal information with these third parties; however, when you
              use the Applications, we or third parties operating the ad serving
              technology may use non-personal information that is collected
              through cookies, anonymous identifiers such as an IDFA on iOS
              devices, web beacons, pixels, clear GIFs, Flash LSOs, JavaScript
              and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of ads and the
              typical click-through rate, which will help ensure that the right
              ads are presented to you. Further, the information acquired may be
              used to perform detailed web and advertising analytics concerning
              your use of the Applications and other websites of interest to
              you. To the extent any of this information is collected by third
              parties, you acknowledge and agree that such collection and use is
              governed by those third parties' privacy policies and we are not
              responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties.  
              <br >
              <br >
              If you are interested in more information about personalized user
              ads and how to prevent third parties from delivering personalized
              ads, you may visit the following third-party websites: the Network
              Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt-Out Page or the Digital
              Advertising Alliance's Consumer Opt-Out Page. Please note that, to
              the extent ad technology is integrated into the Applications, you
              may still receive ads even if you opt-out of tailored ads. In that
              case, the ads will just not be tailored to your interests.  
              <br >
              <br >
              If you are using an iOS device and you do not want to receive
              tailored in-application ads that relate to your interests, you may
              opt-out by accessing the following link on your
              device. http://oo.apple.com. If you are using an Android device
              and you do not wish to receive tailored in-application ads, you
              can visit Google's Ads Preferences page from a browser on your
              device and make your choices there. Please feel free to contact
              AQQIRE Customer Service at any time should you be concerned with
              any data or information being acquired by third parties, and how
              to successfully limit the distribution of your data.

              6. How AQQIRE Discloses Your Information  
              <br >
              <br >
              While AQQIRE does take your privacy extremely seriously, we may
              disclose your information in the following ways:  
              <br >
              <br >
              (a) Make information collected through the Applications available
              to subsidiaries and affiliated companies that are under common
              ownership or control within the AQQIRE.com family.
              <br >
              (b) If you request information on a particular Asset, download
              documents from an Asset's Property Page (i.e., its Due Diligence
              Folder) or submit an offer on a particular Asset, then the seller
              and its representatives will be given access to your information.
              <br >
              (c) Under limited circumstances, AQQIRE may share information
              about our visitors, members, sellers or former members or users
              with the following types of companies that perform Applications on
              our behalf or with whom we have joint marketing agreements:
              <br >
              <br >
              1. Direct mailers, fulfillment service providers, payment
              processors, data processors, customer/support applications or
              services, and other non-financial corporations or entities.
              <br >
              2. Financial service providers such as companies engaged in
              banking, mortgage lending, consumer finance, securities, and
              insurance.
              <br >
              (d) Under limited circumstances, and only to companies we believe
              are of interest to you, we may share or sell, as allowed by
              pertinent U.S. and international law, information about you with
              other companies who may have products and services of interest to
              you. If you would like to opt-out of our sharing of your
              information with these other companies, please contact AQQIRE
              Customer Service.
              <br >
              (e) We may share your information with any person or entity, as
              needed, when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is
              necessary to: (1) comply with the law or in response to a
              subpoena, court order, government request, or other legal process;
              (2) produce relevant documents or information in connection with
              litigation, arbitration, mediation, adjudication, government or
              internal investigations, or other legal or administrative
              proceedings; (3) protect the interests, rights, safety, or
              property of AQQIRE or any subsidiaries and affiliates thereof, or
              others; (4) enforce the Terms & Conditions, Sales Process Terms of
              Use, and other related Applications; (5) provide users of the

              to share your information with any person or entity, as we
              determine is necessary.
              <br >
              (g) Finally, AQQIRE may also use and share any of your

              7. How to Opt Out of Email Correspondence  
              <br >
              <br >
              AQQIRE will send you e-mail communications from time to time,
              which may include a periodic newsletter, updates to our
              Applications, related services or policies, important news in the
              commercial real estate industry that we feel should be shared with
              our users, information on any new promotions or events, and other
              correspondence relating to promotional and/or innovative
              information. If you would rather not receive these communications,
              you may "opt out" by clicking the "Unsubscribe" tab included at
              the base of each e-mail that you are sent by AQQIRE, or by
              contacting AQQIRE Customer Service at privacy@AQQIRE.com. Our team
              will gladly comply with all requests for removal, which AQQIRE
              will execute as soon as possible, within the limits stated in
              applicable law.  
              <br >
              <br >
              However, certain e-mail communications and confirmations regarding
              transactional events, such as confirmation of membership
              registration, confirmation of Offer submitted, and related e-mail
              correspondence, are not included in the e-mails that you can opt
              out of. You will be able to recognize these required e-mails, as
              each of them will lack an "Unsubscribe" tab at the base of the
              message body. Should you have any questions or concerns regarding
              our "opt out" process, please feel free to contact us at your
              convenience at privacy@AQQIRE.com.  
              <br >
              <br >
              8. Account Protection and Security  
              <br >
              <br >
              We have implemented commercially viable electronic, technical,
              administrative, and physical security measures and procedures to
              protect you against the loss, misuse and change of any of your
              personal information. However, despite our highest and best
              efforts, no security measures are impenetrable. We ask that you
              let us know immediately if you suspect that a misuse of your
              information has taken place; and we appreciate your continued
              efforts to safeguard the privacy of your information and that of
              all AQQIRE users.

              9. Children's Information  
              <br >
              <br >
              AQQIRE does not knowingly market to, or collect, any personal
              information from children under the age of 18. If a parent or
              guardian believe that we have, in our database, the personal
              information of any child under the age of 18, we ask that you
              please contact us immediately at privacy@AQQIRE.com. We will use
              our best efforts to promptly remove all such information from our
              database, and endeavor to prevent its further distribution on the
              Applications.

              10. Access to Your Personal Information  
              <br >
              <br >
              If any of your personal information changes or becomes inaccurate
              for any reason, please visit your Account home page to revise and
              update your records. If you no longer wish to use the Applications

              11. Third-Party Links and Applications  
              <br >
              <br >
              Many of the Applications provided or offered by AQQIRE may include
              links to third-party websites, including a variety of social
              networking and related online community websites. If you decide to
              act on the links provided and use the features and services
              offered by many of these websites, your information may be
              collected and/or shared as a result; and this may occur without

              for any of the content offered, or privacy practices used, by any
              other website or service provider to which AQQIRE, or any
              subsidiary or affiliate thereof, is linked via any Application,
              service, e-mail or other component. Moreover, the personal
              information that you may choose to share with any third-party
              website or service provider will not be covered by the AQQIRE
              Privacy Statement. We encourage you to read and fully understand
              the privacy policies of any other websites that you may offer your
              personal information to.

              12. Amendments to Privacy Statement  
              <br >
              <br >
              From time to time, AQQIRE may determine that it is necessary to
              amend this Privacy Statement, and will do so by posting any such
              revised terms here, which will become effective at the time of
              their posting. Your continued use of the Applications following
              any changes shall mean that you accept all such revisions. If and
              when we make any significant changes to this Privacy Statement,
              you will be notified as soon as possible via e-mail or other
              notification methods.

              13. International Transfers of Information  
              <br >
              <br >
              Many of the uses and disclosures mentioned in this Privacy
              Statement may involve the transfer of your personal information to
              various countries around the world that may have different levels
              of privacy protection than your country. By submitting your
              personal information, you consent to any such transfers, and to
              abide by any resultant regulations or rules.

              <br >
              <br >
              Should you have any questions, concerns or comments about this
              Privacy Statement, please contact us by sending an e-mail
              to privacy@AQQIRE.com. In your message, we ask that you please
              provide your name, and mailing address. Please note that we may
              record the conversations that some of you have with AQQIRE
              customer service representatives, agents or employees, so that we
              can monitor the level of service you are receiving, and make any
              changes that we believe would provide you with a better user
              experience. Unfortunately, callers may not "opt out" of the
              recordation procedures, as they are not only used to enhance our
              service protocols, but also to ensure that all AQQIRE
              representatives are following corporate guidelines and providing
              you with the most accurate and beneficial information available at
              that time.
