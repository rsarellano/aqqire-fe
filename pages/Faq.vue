        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold">Is AQQIRE a brokerage firm?</h2>
        <p class="text-sm font-light tracking-wide text-gray-400">
          Nope. AQQIRE is a platform used by brokers, investors and other
          commercial real estate and business professionals. We help CRE and
          Business buyers find acquisitions and we help sellers reach those
          buyers.

        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold">How is this free?</h2>
        <p class="text-sm font-light tracking-wide text-gray-400">

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold">
          Will AQQIRE charge me a commission fee?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-sm font-light tracking-wide text-gray-400">
          Nope. Since we are not brokers, we do not make commission on any
          property sold on the site.

        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold">
          Why would I pay for a paid membership?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-sm font-light tracking-wide text-gray-400">
          Pro members on AQQIRE get added exposure for their properties, their
          companies, and for themselves. Free members get distributed in one
          email for free, while paid members are distributed in multiple emails
          and other channels such as social media.

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold">Is there a long-term commitment?</h2>
        <p class="text-sm font-light tracking-wide text-gray-400">
          There is no long-term commitment unless you have paid for it up front.
          Paid memberships are month to month (or year to year) and can be
          cancelled prior to the next billing period.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold">How do I cancel my membership?</h2>
        <p class="text-sm font-light tracking-wide text-gray-400">
          Cancelling your membership is easy. Just shoot a message over to
          cancellations@aqqire.com and let us know that you want to cancel. At
          the end of your paid term, your account will automatically be
          cancelled. Easier still, you can go to “My Account” and choose
          “Payments”. There you will find a link to cancel your subscription.

        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold">
          Some of these listings look old, how do I know if they're still
          active?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-sm font-light tracking-wide text-gray-400">
          We do the best we can to make sure our members keep their listings up
          to date. We have recently adopted a new rule which states that if
          listings are not updated in 90 days, they will automatically be
          removed from the platform. As with any platform where content is user
          generated, we hope that users will keep said content as accurate and
          truthful as possible.

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold">
          I see a property/business on the site that should not be there. How do
          I fix this?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-sm font-light tracking-wide text-gray-400">
          We rely on a vigilant community to keep the platform as honest as we
          can make it. Our terms of use states that those adding properties to
          the platform need to be the rightful brokers or the rightful owners of
          the properties. Instances of abuse are extremely rare due to the
          honesty of the community along with their willingness to report any
          and all bad data as soon as it is spotted.
