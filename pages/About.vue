        What's the Problem We're Trying to Solve?
      </h2>

      <p class="italic">
        The Commercial Real Estate industry has an issue with content
        distribution. This stems from each brokerage house holding onto
        unshared, private networks. One of the downsides to this model is that
        the brokerage reach becomes very limited.
      </p>

      <p class="italic">
        Since the reach of individual brokerage houses can be weak, there is
        high opportunity cost. They may not be reaching the audience that is
        actually interested in the properties that they have listed.
      </p>

      <p class="italic">
        Furthermore, these private networks tend to include many of the same
        individuals. Brokers that attend the same trade shows end up recruiting
        the same people for their databases.
      </p>

      <p class="italic">
        E-mail is a popular distribution method for many brokerage firms, but if
        they are reaching out to the same people weekly, or even daily, the
        recipients become fatigued with all of the low value content.
      </p>

      <h2 class="my-4 text-3xl font-bold">Solution</h2>
      <p class="italic">
        The solution is to build an open, multi-sided platform that allows
        information to move freely. Having an open platform will allow sellers
        and brokers to maximize their reach while allowing potential buyers to
        receive high value content.
      </p>

      <h2 class="my-4 text-3xl font-bold">What is a Platform Business?</h2>

      <p class="italic">
        A platform business uses technology to connect people and organizations
        in an interactive ecosystem where value can be created and exchanged. In
        this case AQQIRE’s main purpose is to connect sellers with buyers with
        the purpose of generating interest in investment opportunities. We
        leverage user behavior, advanced marketing technologies and algorithms
        to facilitate the best matches for business acquisitions.
      </p>

      <p class="italic">
        AQQIRE is an evolution from The Hotel Inventory, which used technology
        to help sellers distribute for sale properties to a greater audience. It
        used its website to learn about user preferences and then used email and
        social media marketing to amplify messages to targeted markets.

      <h2 class="my-4 text-3xl font-bold">History</h2>
      <p class="italic">
        <span class="italic font-bold">Rob Astudillo</span>
        founded The Hotel Inventory in 2009 after serving as the marketing and
        advertising director for a hotel brokerage firm in Los Angeles,
        California. Identifying that there was no online community for
        hospitality real estate investors, he created The Hotel Inventory.
      </p>

      <p class="italic">
        <span class="italic font-bold">Mukesh Mowji</span>
        and
        <span class="italic font-bold">Tarun Patel</span>
        founded Pracrea, Inc. around the same time. Their first software release
        was a tool called Proceso and it aimed to create an end-to-end solution
        for hotel brokers to facilitate the sale of a property.
      </p>

      <p class="italic">
        Recognizing that they needed a marketing tool as part of their offering,
        they were introduced to Rob and The Hotel Inventory in 2013. The three
        realized that they could combine forces and become a much stronger
        company. In 2014, they merged and in 2015 decided to focus on The Hotel
        Inventory’s strong marketing engine to connect the hospitality
        community. Today, the goal is to connect the entire commercial real
        estate community.
