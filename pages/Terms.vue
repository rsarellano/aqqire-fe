              and are granted specifically to the subscribing registered user
              only. User rights cannot be assigned, sublicensed, distributed,

              "User," and You represent and warrant that the information You
              provide is true, accurate, complete, and current. Each User must
              maintain a valid email address and a password, which shall be
              utilized for logging on to the AQQIRE system. Users are not
              permitted to share their individual login information with others.
              AQQIRE has the right to refuse or terminate service to any User,
              individual, organization, or firm (and all persons associated or
              affiliated with said organization or firm) that fails to abide by
              the Terms and Conditions as posted and displayed on the AQQIRE
              website, or abuses its rights related to the Service..  
              <br >

              owned or possessed by any third party; (c) there are no claims,
              judgments or settlements to be paid by You, or pending claims or
              litigation, relating to such content; and (d) You will fully
              indemnify the Company against any and all damages or other losses,
              and any related attorney's fees, other fees, and/or expenses,
              incurred by the Company as a result of any breach of the foregoing
              representations or in connection with Your Submitted Content,
              including without limitation as a result of any claim brought by a
              third party in connection with Your Submitted Content, whether or
              not such claim prevails. With respect to all Submitted Content You
              have uploaded in the past or elect to upload in the future, post,
              e-mail or otherwise transmit to or via the Service, AQQIRE
              acknowledges that you retain any applicable ownership rights that
              You may have with respect to the Submitted Content. You
              nonetheless grant AQQIRE and its affiliates and their licensees a
              royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive and
              fully sub-licensable right and license (through multiple tiers) to
              use, reproduce, adapt, perform, display, publish, translate,
              prepare derivative works from, modify, distribute, sell, and take
              any other action with respect to all such Submitted Content (in
              whole or part), whether submitted in the past or in the future,
              and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media, or
              technology now known or later developed. Customers further
              acknowledge and agree that AQQIRE may preserve any such Submitted
              Content, whether submitted in the past or in the future, and may
              also disclose such Submitted Content in its sole discretion
              (including without limitation within other products offered by
              AQQIRE ). Customers agree not to submit any Submitted Content to
              AQQIRE unless Customer has received all necessary rights and
              authorizations, including from the photographer or videographer
              and/or copyright owner of any photographs or videos, to publish
              and advertise the property listing on Customer’s website and
              AQQIRE's website. Specifically, Customer will not submit a
              photograph if Customer received the photograph from a third party
              information provider under the terms of a license that does not
              allow posting of such photograph or video on the AQQIRE website.
              Customers may only submit videos personally created by them or
              their direct employees. Customers may not upload or otherwise
              submit videos created or produced by third-party video tour
              providers. Where Customers listing incorporates content provided
              by AQQIRE or its affiliates, such as property photos or other
              images or information (collectively, "AQQIRE Materials"), Member
              is granted a limited, revocable, exclusive and non-sub-licensable
              license to use such AQQIRE Materials strictly in connection with
              Customer’s AQQIRE listing. All other rights to AQQIRE Materials
              are expressly reserved. The Company may, in its sole discretion
              but without any obligation to search for such, remove property
              listings that are alleged to have been submitted in violation of
              this provision. In addition, the Company may require additional
              evidence of compliance with this provision from Members who are
              alleged to have submitted property listings, Submitted Content or
              other information in violation of these binding Terms and
              Conditions. The Company will, in its sole discretion, terminate
              the accounts of, and refuse service to, any Customer who
              repeatedly or knowingly violates these binding Terms and
              Conditions. Customer agrees to maintain accurate contact
              information (specifically, a valid phone number and email address)
              in order to submit and maintain active property listings on the
              AQQIRE website. No robot, spider or other automated service may be
              used to submit listings to the Service. The Company shall have the
              sole authority to choose the manner in which any property listing
              will be searched, displayed, accessed, viewed, downloaded, copied,
              and otherwise used on the AQQIRE website and Company shall have
              the right to modify the property listing in the exercise of its
              rights under these binding Terms and Conditions. Listings that are
              not modified or renewed within a 90-day period are automatically
              changed to "Off Market" and are no longer viewable on AQQIRE.com.
              Member (a) represents and warrants that all properties and
              associated information provided by Member, including Submitted
              Content, will be accurate; (b) agrees not to post a property
              listing on the AQQIRE marketplace under a name other than the
              individually named licensed real estate agent or agents that have
              been engaged by the property owner to market the property under
              the terms of a duly executed listing agreement with the owner
              (shared accounts, e.g. listings@abcrealty.com are strictly
              prohibited); (c) agrees to administer the properties provided by
              Customer and maintain their accuracy at all times. The Company
              reserves, in a manner consistent with reasonable commercial
              business practices, the right to remove all or any part of the
              property listings posted on the AQQIRE website. Customer is
              entirely responsible, and Company accepts no responsibility, for
              the Submitted Content from the Customer. While the Company will
              undertake reasonable efforts for data backup and business
              resumption, Customer will be solely responsible for retaining
              back-up copies of all information, photographs and other materials
              it provides to AQQIRE. AQQIRE may add digital watermarks to
              certain parts of your property listing, including photographs. We
              add these digital watermarks to protect against the copying or
              further distribution of your photographs without your permission.
              Customer agrees that AQQIRE may adjust portions of the information
              contained within the Service (e.g., within property listings). Any
              such adjustments will have no material impact on the meaning and
              interpretation of property listings, but will serve as a means of
              uniquely identifying the property listings. Customer accepts that
              this is a legitimate and lawful security precaution on the part of
              AQQIRE, and accepts further that in the event that any third party
              has access to property listings that can be identified as having
              such unique adjustments, this shall constitute a prima facie
              breach of security and of these Terms and Conditions.

              <br >
              Listing Review 
              <br >
              All listings entered on AQQIRE may be subject to review by AQQIRE
              company personnel ("Listing Review") prior to becoming available
              for full viewing online. AQQIRE reserves the right, but not the
              obligation, to review any listing entered by Customer on AQQIRE.
              Although Customer’s listings may be subject to Listing Review,
              Customer remains solely responsible for abiding by AQQIRE’s Terms
              and Conditions.   By entering listings on AQQIRE, Customer
              warrants and represents that Customer owns or otherwise controls
              all of the rights to such content including, without limitation,
              all the rights necessary for Customer to provide, post, upload,
              input or submit such content. Customer acknowledges that AQQIRE
              cannot police or control all of the content provided by
              Customer(s) that is made available on AQQIRE.  
              <br >
              <br >
              Listings that violate any of the policies stated herein will not
              receive Listing Review approval for active posting on AQQIRE until
              the issue in question has been addressed. When conducting Listing
              Review, new listings added to AQQIRE are examined to determine
              whether such listings are in compliance with our policies. In the
              event Listing Review determines a listing violates Listing
              Policies (including but not limited to containing inaccurate or
              incomplete information), Listing Review will send an email message
              to the Customer about such listing, clearly stating how such
              proposed listing does not conform to established policies and
              offering solutions on how to rectify the deficiency. After the
              Customer receives notice from Listing Review, the Customer will be
              given a reasonable amount of time (routinely, 48 hours) to
              respond. It is then the sole responsibility of the Customer to
              review the communication from Listing Review, revise the listing
              as appropriate, and resubmit the corrected listing. Once the
              appropriate revision has been made, and Listing Review determines
              the listing is compliant with Listing Policies, the listing will
              be made available for full viewing on the site. However, if the
              Customer fails to respond to the communication from Listing
              Review, AQQIRE in its sole discretion reserves the right to remove
              any and all content that continues to violate the Listing
              Policies, including disallowing listings from the Service.

              required fields and must be completed with valid data pertaining

              Zip Code are recommended fields. These fields are intended for
              listing the physical address of the property being listed. AQQIRE
              reserves the right to remove any and all property listings with

              field with or without contacting the listing broker.

              Property Description  
              <br >
              Property descriptions are for the description of the property that
              is for sale or for lease only. The posting of contact name, phone
              number, fax number, company information or URL links for any
              contacts including those who are not AQQIRE members is strictly
              prohibited in this section. This type of information in the
              Property Description field will be removed from the listing and
              the listing broker will receive an email informing them of the
              change. Habitual violations of this policy will result in AQQIRE's
              removal of all of such Customer's active listings on the Service
              until all such content has been appropriately rectified.

              <br >
              A valid Sales Price in the Price Asking field for the listed
              property is recommended for all AQQIRE Sale Listings and a valid
              rental rate for each space is recommended for all AQQIRE Lease
              Listings. By entering a valid Asking Price in the required field
              and utilizing this function, properties will return in price range
              searches. AQQIRE reserves the right to remove all listings that
              are deemed to have invalid prices or rental rates including any
              listing with $0 listed in Lease Rate, Sales Price and Opinion of
              Value fields.

              Commercial Property  
              <br >
              AQQIRE is a web site for commercial real estate. Listing of
              single-family residences is prohibited on the AQQIRE website,
              except if such residences have a residential income purpose (e.g.
              to purchase a residence whose customary use has been as a rental
              property), in which case such properties may by listed under the
              Residential Income category only. The listing of single family
              residential income property under all other categories is
              prohibited. Any listing deemed to be a non-income generating,
              single-family residence will be removed from the system during the
              listing approval process and an email will be sent to the Customer
              stating that the property has been identified as a single-family
              residential property.

              Duplicates  
              <br >
              Property Listings  AQQIRE prohibits the listing of a single
              property more than once on the web site at the same time. A
              duplicate is defined as the same physical property listed under
              more than one property ID. AQQIRE reserves the right to remove any
              and all properties that are determined to be duplicates with or
              without contacting the listing broker. Customers may, however,
              list a property for sale and for lease at the same time.  
              <br >

              Space Listings  AQQIRE prohibits the listing of the same space
              more than once on the web site at the same time. A space listing
              is defined as a single suite or unit of space listed for lease.
              AQQIRE provides minimum divisible/maximum contiguous options for
              divisible space and up to three (3) subcategories for space type
              under space detail. Total space available in a building cannot
              exceed the total square footage of the building. AQQIRE reserves
              the right to combine duplicate space listings into a single
              listing or to remove the listing from the system with or without
              contacting the listing broker.

              Use of Photographs  
              <br >
              Building photographs posted, attached, or affixed to listings must
              be actual photographs of the building being listed. All such
              photographs must be either (a) the property of the listing broker
              or (b) the listing broker must have received all necessary rights
              and authorizations, including from the photographer and/or
              copyright owner of any photographs, to publish such photographs on
              the Customer's website or on AQQIRE's website for the purpose of
              advertising the subject property. Photographs uploaded that are
              not directly related to the building or property being listed,
              including brokerage company logos, may be removed at the
              discretion of AQQIRE.

              Prohibited Conduct
              <br >
              Customers are advised to refrain from engaging in the conduct
              specified in this section, as it is not permitted on the AQQIRE
              Service.

              "Billboard" Listings  
              <br >
              Listings on AQQIRE are for properties that are currently offered
              for Sale or Lease. It is not permitted to post listings on the
              Service that have already been sold or are no longer on the
              market, i.e. posting listings on the Service for marketing or
              advertising purposes ("Billboard Listings"). All listings for
              properties already sold or off-market will be removed.

              <br >
              Keyword Manipulation  
              <br >
              AQQIRE offers the ability to search for properties on key words.
              This is designed to enable searchers to narrow their criteria
              based on specific requirements. Keyword manipulation is unfair to
              searchers by returning listings that clearly do not meet their
              criteria. Keywords identified in the property name, property
              description, location description or property highlights field
              that are clearly not relevant to the property being marketed will
              be removed by Listing Review. Habitual abuse of this policy by a
              Customer may, at the sole discretion of AQQIRE, lead to the
              removal of all of that Customer's active listings from the web
              site and suspension of that Customer's ability to list properties
              on the Service.

              Offensive Language  
              <br >
              Use of profanity or vulgar language in any section of the AQQIRE
              database is strictly prohibited. This includes the use of language
              that is generally considered obscene, profane, sexual, hateful, or
              racist in nature. Listing or user information that includes
              profane language will be removed from the Service immediately.
              Customers posting such language to the AQQIRE web site may be
              subject to disciplinary action, including indefinite suspension of
              a Customer's account, temporary suspension or a formal warning.

                Payment Terms  
              <br >
              Customer agrees to pay for all products ordered through the AQQIRE
              website or via the AQQIRE sales team using the payment method
              indicated, and provides AQQIRE express authorization to charge
              said fees to the Customer's payment provider at time of purchase
              or renewal. Fees owed depend on the specific type and quantity of
              AQQIRE products, services, information, or deliverables
              (collectively "Deliverables") ordered. Payment of fees shall not
              be contingent on any events other than the delivery of the ordered
              Deliverables. Any attorney fees, court costs, or other costs
              incurred in collection of delinquent undisputed amounts shall be
              the responsibility of and paid for by Customer. If payment is not
              current, AQQIRE may immediately cease to provide any and all
              Deliverables to the Customer. The fees do not include sales, use,
              excise or any other taxes or fees now or hereafter imposed by any
              governmental authority with respect to the Deliverables. At
              AQQIRE's option, Customer shall pay such taxes or fees directly or
              pay to AQQIRE any such taxes or fees immediately upon invoicing by
              AQQIRE. AQQIRE is required to collect sales tax on purchases in
              select states. Recurring charges will include sales tax in
              accordance with applicable laws of your state. Customer loyalty or
              product bundle discounts are subject to cancellation. For
              subscriptions, AQQIRE may increase subscription prices
              periodically. The fees paid for monthly subscriptions are
              non-refundable, regardless of whether the subscription is
              terminated prior to the end of the then-current monthly billing
              period. No partial month refunds will be provided. Except as
              otherwise provided herein, all other member subscriptions,
              including quarterly and annual commitment subscriptions, will
              automatically renew for additional terms equaling the original
              term unless Customer or AQQIRE provides thirty (30) days' advance
              written notice of non-renewal. Quarterly and annual commitment
              subscriptions may be canceled as of the end of term only; no
              mid-term cancellations will be permitted. All cancellation and
              non-renewal requests by Customer will be processed within five (5)
              business days. Once the cancellation is processed, a confirmation
              email will be sent via the Customer's email account on record with
              AQQIRE.  
              <br >
              <br >
              If Customer has a question about a cancellation, Customer should
              contact AQQIRE accounting team at accounting@AQQIRE.com or at
              408-573-1210. The Company reserves the right to change its fees or
              billing methods at any time. The Company will provide timely
              notice to the affected Customers of any such changes.  
              <br >
              <br >
              It is the Customer's responsibility to promptly provide the
              Company with any contact or billing information changes or updates
              (including phone number, email address, credit card numbers,
              etc.).  
              <br >
              <br >
              The Customer must notify AQQIRE about any billing problems or
              discrepancies within 90 days after charges first appear on their
              Account statement. If it is not brought to AQQIRE's attention
              within 90 days, Customer agrees to waive their right to dispute
              such problems or discrepancies.

              AQQIRE reserves the right to terminate or suspend a Customer's
              account upon a good faith determination of a violation of these
              binding Terms and Conditions or any material provision of another
              agreement between the parties or their affiliates. Cause for
              termination includes, but is not limited to, breaches or
              violations of the Terms and Conditions, requests by law
              enforcement, fraudulent or illegal activity by you, discontinuance
              or material modification of AQQIRE services, nonpayment of fees
              owed by you in connection with AQQIRE or its affiliates' services,
              account inactivity or technical or security issues. Upon

              Brokers and Agents
              <br >
              Any Customer who identifies himself or herself as a broker or
              agent on the AQQIRE website member registration form or otherwise
              purports to be a broker on AQQIRE's Find a Broker service hereby
              represents and warrants that Customer is validly licensed as a
              broker and is in compliance with applicable broker requirements in
              all jurisdictions in which Customer is required to be licensed.
              The Company may, in its sole discretion, but without any
              obligation to verify the licensure of such individual as a broker
              or agent, remove from the list of brokers any Customer whom the
              Company believes is not a licensed broker or agent in any
              applicable jurisdiction. The Company may, in its sole discretion,
              terminate the accounts of, and refuse services to, any Customer
              who repeatedly or knowingly misrepresents its licensed broker or
              agent status or upon notification by any state agency or similar
              governmental authority that such Customer is not a licensed
              broker. AQQIRE does not and shall not have any obligation to
              independently verify the licensure of individuals identified as
              brokers and agents on the website. It is your responsibility to
              confirm the licensed status of any brokers listed on the AQQIRE
              website.

              Governing Law; Customer Right to Arbitrate
              <br >
              These binding Terms and Conditions, and the Deliverables provided
              by AQQIRE, shall be governed by the laws of the state of
              California, without reference to conflict of laws principles. You
              hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the
              State and Federal courts of the State of California for the
              adjudication of any disputes or claims arising out of and/or
              related to these binding Terms and Conditions. If any provision of
              these binding Terms and Conditions is found to be invalid or
              unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision
              shall be severed from the remainder of these Terms and Conditions,
              which shall remain in full force and effect.
              <br >
              <br >
              You acknowledge that any breach of these binding Terms and
              Conditions, including without limitation the restrictions on
              competitor use, viewing, or access and the sections above titled
              "Submission and Administration of Listings" and "Use of
              Information," or any unauthorized use of the Service, is a
              material breach of the Agreement and will cause irreparable harm
              and injury to the Company, for which there is no adequate remedy
              at law. Thus, in addition to all other remedies available at law
              or in equity, You agree that the Company shall be entitled to
              injunctive relief. Any User, Member, Customer, or other individual
              or entity that violates any term of these binding Terms and
              Conditions is precluded from enforcing, agrees not to enforce, and
              covenants not to sue to enforce, any similar contract, including
              terms and conditions, terms of use and terms of service, asserted
              by such User, Member, Customer, or other individual or entity, or
              any affiliate thereof, as binding upon AQQIRE. Material breach of
              these binding Terms and Conditions harms the integrity,
              functionality, and reputation of AQQIRE and its affiliates;
              detracts from Users' and Customers' trust in and use of the
              Service; and unfairly harms, thereby causing damage to, the
              business of AQQIRE. You agree that, in the event You materially
              breach these binding Terms and Conditions, You will pay AQQIRE's
              reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, to be determined by a court
              or arbitrator, but not less than $30,000, an amount the parties
              agree would be the minimum reasonable fee for any legal action
              required to enforce these binding Terms and Conditions.
              <br >
              <br >
              Assignment
              <br >
              This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the
              benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
              permitted assigns. The rights under this Agreement or any license
              granted hereunder may not be assigned, sublicensed or otherwise
              transferred by Customer without the prior written consent of
              AQQIRE, which retains the right to withhold consent in its sole
              discretion.
              <br >
              <br >
              Waiver and Severability
              <br >
              The failure of AQQIRE to exercise or enforce a legal right or
              remedy contained in the Terms and Conditions does not constitute a
              waiver of any such right or remedy. No waiver of any right, term
              or provision of the Terms and Conditions is deemed a waiver of any
              other right, term or provision. If a court of competent
              jurisdiction finds any provision of the Terms and Conditions to be
              invalid, You agree that the remaining terms and provisions remain
              in full force and effect.
              <br >
              <br >
              Notices
              <br >
              All notices to Company must be in writing and must be sent
              registered mail, certified mail, or overnight mail with a return
              receipt requested to Member Services at AQQIRE.
              <br >
              <br >
              Entire Agreement
              <br >
              Except as provided herein, the terms and conditions of this
              Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties and
              supersede all previous agreements and understanding, whether oral
              or written, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject
              matter of this Agreement.
